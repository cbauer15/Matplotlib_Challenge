Observations:
1.   The drug trial(s) consisted of 10 drug regimens, including a placebo.  Each drug regimen used 25 mice for their trial; excluding the Stelasyn / Propriva which used 24 mice for their trials.  Overall 248 mice were used with 125 (50.4%) being male and 123 (49.6%) being female.  (Note: More mice may have been sampled in the original study, however, inconsistent/duplicate data is omitted in our analysis)
2. We took a closer look at four drugs in particular: Ramicane, Capomulin, Ceftamin, and Infubinol.  Of these four drugs Ramicane and Capomulin had significantly lower average tumor volumes.  This lower average volume could mean that Ramicane/Capomulin are more effective at treating tumors than Ceftamin/Infubinol.  The use of Capomulin resulting in a tumor shrinking from ~45mm3 to ~39mm3 from the beginning to the end of the trail, this trend was observed in Mouse B128
3. In this study, the weight of the sample mice and the volume of their tumors are positively corrected.  This positive correlation means that as the tumor increase in volume, the mouse will increase in weight.  The same observation also applies in the reverse; meaning that as the size of the tumor decreases so does the weight of the mouse.
